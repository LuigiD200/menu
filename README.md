Menu V1.1
A Java class for creating multiple-choice menus automatically.

Main class is for menu examples
Menu class is the main class of this project

I intentionally put "main" and "menu" in such a way you get confused by reading it the first time.


VERSION 1.0 - Created the class with basic methods
VERSION 1.1 - Added option for looped menus
